Problems:
 - Interesting bug - If you make height or width of a component negative. componentColHandle fails to work. 
 - allow objects to skid for componentColHandle()
 - try to delete the obstacle after it goes off screen. right now I just add obstacles forever. 
 
 Git Problems:
 - Git question: after you commit changes does the local git basically become a backup? what's the command to use the local git to change the uncommited current git?
 - What exactly does git merge do? which merges with which?
 - what is the point of git's two step add/commit process?
 - If you committed something to a branch of local git, can you backup to that if you break your code?
